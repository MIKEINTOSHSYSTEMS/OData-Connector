# Impact++ Google Data Studio ODK Central connector

This repository is maintained by [Impact++](https://sites.google.com/view/udubimpact/home?authuser=0), a student-run [RSO](https://huskylink.washington.edu/organization/uwimpact) at UW Seattle, focused on helping students contribute to the open source world. 

The goal of this repository is to write an OData connector, specifically for [ODK Central](https://odkcentral.docs.apiary.io/#reference/odata-endpoints/metadata-document), so that users of Google Data Studio can use ODK data as a data source.  

For a tutorial concerning use and editing of this connector, see our [guide](https://github.com/UDub-Impact/OData-Connector/blob/master/connector%20guide.md).

# Notes
- Google Cloud Platform project for our connector is at [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=getodk-gds) (this is an ODK resource.)
- This connector is deployed on Apps Script, a platform hosted by Google. The deployed script project can be found [here](https://script.google.com/home/projects/1wqcrVE9bDDIpmldgHWpQCtnB9isz_aWxhbSM_udaTgFR02vp2z079B-S)
- ln@getodk.org, email@getodk.org are the administrators on all resources and have access to the Google Cloud Platform account and can access/change the script if needed.
