# Impact++ Google Data Studio ODK Central connector

This repository is maintained by [Impact++](https://sites.google.com/view/udubimpact/home?authuser=0), a student-run [RSO](https://huskylink.washington.edu/organization/uwimpact) at UW Seattle, focused on helping students contribute to the open source world. 

The goal of this repository is to write an OData connector, specifically for [ODK Central](https://odkcentral.docs.apiary.io/#reference/odata-endpoints/metadata-document), so that users of Google Data Studio can use ODK data as a data source.  

For a tutorial concerning use and editing of this connector, see our [guide](https://github.com/UDub-Impact/OData-Connector/blob/master/connector%20guide.md).
